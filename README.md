## Features

### Account

Create new wallets with user-given seed phrase or an auto-generated seed phrase. 

> **Warning**
>
> Do NOT use your mainnet account here. The mnemonic is stored in plain text within vscode

Once an account has been created, you can do the following actions

* Request funds from faucet (if [@cosmjs/faucet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/faucet) compatible faucet has been set up)
* Copy address to clipboard

    The address is derived from prefix from the current active chain config

* Copy mnemonic or seed phrase to clipboard
* Delete the account from vscode 

    The address and funds persists on-chain.

* Open in Block Explorer (if `accountExplorerLink` has been set up for currently active chain)

If you see an account balance as `NaN`, it probably means your RPC endpoint is not reachable. Ensure the endpoint is reachable and run `cosmy-wasmy.refreshAccount` to fetch the account balances.

#### Beaker Integration

If your settings have been configured such that `beaker.autosync` is enabled, all the accounts and chain configurations from the `Beaker.toml` will be imported into the extension. 

Alternatively, you can also right-click and on a `Beaker.toml` file and select "Sync Beaker Config" to manually sync the accounts and chain configs.

> **Note**
> Ensure the Beaker.toml is present in the root of your repository for auto-sync.


### Contract

Any contracts deployed on-chain, can be imported by their contract address so that they can be interacted with using the extension. Only contracts which were imported with the current active chain are displayed.

Once a contract has been imported, you can do the following from the context menu

* Copy contract address
* View contract checksum from chain
* Download contract binary from chain

    The contract is saved in the root of the repository with name `{contractAddress}.wasm`
* Delete the contract from vscode 
    
    The contract and its state persists on-chain.

* Change the contract admin 

    Changes the cosmwasm admin, not any admin set up by the contract itself

* Remove the contract admin 

    Changes the cosmwasm admin, not any admin set up by the contract itself

* Add notes and comments

     Developer can add some notes and comments about the smart contracts which will be saved locally in the extension. Its not connected to any on-chain or cosmwasm feature. It is just for a developer's self reference. This information is shown when the user hovers on the contract in the view. Markdown as well as [codicons](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) are supported in the comments.


    

> **Note**
>
> If any imported contract has a disconnected plug icon next to it, it implies that the contract was imported before v1.0.0 of the extension came out and the extension does not have the relevant information as to which chain config it was imported with. You can delete the contract and reimport it to set it up right

### Cosmwasm

The following Cosmwasm related interactions are possible with the help of the extension

* Query

    * Input the JSON request query data and select the smart contract from the above view to query and the response/err will be output. The historical queries are also stored and can be accessed by `Show Cosmwasm History` command for easy re-execution.

    * OR, Open a JSON file, and click on the `Run Query` button.

* Execute

    * Input the JSON request tx data and select the smart contract as well as the wallet account from the above view to sign and broadcast the transaction and the response/err will be output. You can also send any funds from your wallet for the msg execution as well. The historical txs are also stored and can be accessed by `Show Cosmwasm History `command for easy re-execution.

    * OR, Open a JSON file, and click on the `Execute Tx` button.

* Sign

    Input the text which needs to be signed and select the wallet account in the view above and the signature/err will be output

* Migrate

    Input the JSON request migrate data and select the smart contract as well as the wallet account from the above view to sign and broadcast the transaction and the response/err will be output

* Initialize

    Specify the Code Id of the uploaded contract wasm and provide a label for the smart contract. Include any JSON initialization information needed and select the wallet account from the account view to sign and broadcast the transaction and the response/err will be output. You can also send any funds needed by the contract for the initialization.

    The selected account will be set as admin for the contract.

* Upload

    You can also upload a wasm file to selected chain with selected account.

    Right clicking on a wasm file shows this command in the context menu or right clicking on the tab of the currently open wasm file shows this command in the context menu or command can be invoked using Command Palette/Key Binding and file dialog opens to select a wasm file.

* Simulate

    Right clicking on a wasm file shows you the command to Load the contract in Virtual Machine. Click on this and you will get access to the contract simulation view. You can instantiate the contract multiple times. Run queries against the contract as well as execute messages. You can view the event history of the VM as well.

    The inputs for the contract might be pre-populated based on the schema found in the repository. But thats just a suggestion. You can input arbitrary json into the simulations.

### Notebooks

Th extension now supports CosmWasm Notebooks. Any file stored with the file extension  `*.cwnotebook` is treated as a CW Notebook. CW Notebooks are similar to Jupyter notebooks where you can store in snippets of code in the middle of notebook documentation. 

In the notebook you can configure a contract binary and its schema in TOML block as given below
```toml
[config]
contract-url = "https://../contract.wasm"
schema-url = "https://../contract.json"
```
Any contract interactions in the notebook will be run against this contract. The contract is loaded into a CW virtual machine. 

To use the notebook, first execute the TOML block and then you can run the instantiate json and then the contract has been setup in the VM to be used for query and msg executions.

![CW Notebook execution](./walkthrough/notebooks/run.gif)

You can use as many markdown or JSON blocks in the notebook as needed. However, there should be only one TOML block with the contract configuration.


### Misc

#### Localization

The extension has localization support enabled. However, it is currently only available in English. You can choose to contribute other languages. You can find more details on how to do that in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### Test Explorer

The extension does not implement any Rust language features as it is recommended to use the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension. However, the `rust-analyzer` extension does not provide Test Explorer features yet. This has been implemented such that native vscode Test Explorer will identify any Cosmwasm tests in your code and you can run your tests from there.

#### Walkthroughs

The extension provides Walkthroughs for the major features. You can access the walkthroughs by going to Command Palette (Windows: `Ctrl+Shft+P`, MacOS: `Cmd+Shft+P`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shft+P`) and selecting **"Welcome: Open Walkthrough"**

There are five walkthroughs available:
1. Getting Started with Cosmy Wasmy
2. Cosmy Wasmy: Accounts
3. Cosmy Wasmy: Contracts
4. Cosmy Wasmy: CW Notebooks
5. Cosmy Wasmy: Cosmwasm Interactions

It is recommended to run through them as they provide detailed information on how to use the extension.
